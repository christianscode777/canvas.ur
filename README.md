# Chat.ur

## Overview
Chat.ur is an innovative chat application that merges the convenience of messaging with the immersive experience of a 3D virtual world. Built using three.js, this platform allows users to interact within a three-dimensional island where they can manage messages and partake in a unique communal drawing experience.

## Development Status
The development of Chat.ur is currently underway. The project structure includes backend and frontend components designed to work together to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

## Backend Structure
The backend of Chat.ur is organized as follows:
- `config`: Contains configuration files for the application's various services and environments.
- `controllers`: Holds the logic for processing incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
- `models`: Defines the schema for the application's data and handles database interactions.
- `server.js`: The entry point for the backend server, setting up the API endpoints, middleware, and database connections.

## Frontend Components (Inferred from filenames)
- `main.jsx`: Likely the main React component or entry point of the frontend application.
- `App.jsx`: Represents the root component that wraps the entire frontend application.
- `threescene.jsx`: A dedicated component to handle the three.js scene, possibly where the 3D world is rendered.

## Features
- Two-factor authentication using OAuth for secure logins.
- A central mailbox within the 3D world for managing messages.
- A magical tree that acts as a communal canvas for drawing and sharing visual messages.
